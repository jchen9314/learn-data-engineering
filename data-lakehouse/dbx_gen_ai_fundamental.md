# Generative AI Fundamental

## Introducing Generative AI

### Generative AI Basics

- AI: a multidisciplinary field of CS that aims to create systems capable of emulating and surpassing human-level intelligence
- ML: learn from existing data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed
- DL: use "artificial neural network" to learn from data
- Gen AI: sub-field of AI that focuses on **generating** new content such as image, text, audio, video, code, 3d objects, synthetic data

#### Factors making Gen AI possible now

- Large datasets:
  - availability of large and diverse datasets
  - AI models learn patterns, correlations, and characteristics of large datasets
  - pre-trained state-of-the-art models
- Computational power:
  - advancements in hardware; GPUs
  - access to cloud computing
  - open-source software, hugging face
- Innovative DL models
  - Generative Adversarial networks (GANs)
  - Transformers architecture
  - Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)

### LLMs and Generative AI

- LLM (large language model)
  - model trained on massive datasets to achieve advanced language processing capabilities; Based on DL neural networks
  - structure:
    - encoder
    - transformer
    - decoder
- Foundation model (GPT-4, BART, MPT-7B etc.): large ML model trained on vast amount of data and fine-tuned for more specific language understanding and generation tasks
